description: Resetting intentions for writing on this new website.
---

I’ve rewritten my website a few times in the past. I don’t think that’s because each iteration was drastically different. I think it’s because I’ve always struggled to capture the essence of myself in a set of screens. This latest iteration is no different. It’s closer to who I am now, and where I’m going, but it might keep evolving.

One reason I’ve wanted to redesign and rebuild this site from the ground up is related to how I share my writing online. Sharing one’s work is inherently scary, whether there’s a large audience waiting for the content or not. Writing, like other art, leaves the artist exposed to criticism, rejection, judgement. Simultaneously, writing opens an artist to opportunity, connection, and clarity of expression.

I’m ready to approach writing online with a new mindset.

My intentions in writing this blog are to:

- Publish collections of half baked thoughts, not (necessarily) polished essays
- Write a mix of technical and non-technical posts
- Write to clarify my thinking and share my opinions
