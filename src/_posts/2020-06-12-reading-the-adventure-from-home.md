There are two mind and heart opening activities we can do for ourselves, by ourselves. Those two solo activities are traveling and reading. Both of them give us opportunities to create transformative change.

Travel is eye opening. It's the epitome of adventure and newness. When one travels, they're in the eye of the storm of change. New information, people, sights, sounds, and smells change our perspective and help us grow. That isn't a surprise to anyone.

But in times like these, where travel isn't as easy as it used to be, reading can be an even better replacement.

I like to think of reading as my "Adventure From Home."

But reading is better than a simple escape. It's a way to learn, grow and expose ourselves to a variety of perspectives, without having to leave the couch.

The bestselling author Neil Gaiman captures it beautifully:

> "A book is a dream you hold in your hands."

So much love, time, expertise, and effort goes into crafting a great book. It can take years or even decades, to write a book. And miraculously, we can consume such depth of knowledge and storytelling in a few hours.

While we live vicariously through characters, people, and concepts, we expand the limits of our understanding and empathy.

The benefits of reading are widely known, but some still view it as a chore or something "productive." It's kind of like the kale smoothie of the content world. But reading can be a chocolate chip cookie too. It's just a matter of finding the books that speak most eloquently to us.

The other incredible thing about reading is that there is infinite material to read. If I spent every waking minute of my life reading, I wouldn't be close to scratching the surface of what there is to imbibe.

As our tastes and understandings and curiosities evolve, so does the breadth of reading material. Recently started thinking about hiking? There's a book for that. Want to experience a dystopian sci-fi world? There's a book for that, too. There's a book on everything in the world, and recognizing that abundance cannot be overstated.

Personally, I love to get whisked away into fantasy worlds, grounded by tales in business, explore the depths of history, and learn through the thought leadership of experts.

Where will your next adventure from home take you?
