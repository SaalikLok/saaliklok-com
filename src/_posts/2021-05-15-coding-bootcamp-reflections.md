description: My biggest takeaways from the months of coding full-time.

---
Last week was the final week of my web development bootcamp! ðŸ¥³

I learned so much, leveled up a ton, and am so excited for where my career and life is headed. 

Here are my biggest takeaways from the months of coding full-time ðŸ‘‡

**1. A structured curriculum is an accelerator for learning, as long as we know what we want to learn.** 

Being self-taught to a degree before bootcamp led me to focus and ask questions on the concepts I knew I struggled with. This led to so many aha! moments. 

**2. Half the battle is knowing where + how to look for answers.** 

Metaphorically, coding bootcamp taught me to fish and also led me to the best rivers. 

It's a glorious feeling to be debugging my code and writing tests with newfound confidence.

**3. Feedback is invaluable when learning a new skill.** 

When I started coding years ago, I was tinkering by myself. I had no one to tell me whether my code was faulty, if I could approach a problem another way, or if a div was misaligned. 

Feedback leads to higher quality.

**What's next?** 

â€¢ I'm looking for my next gig as a software engineer

â€¢ I'll keep working on webdev projects

â€¢ I'll be writing more regularly (finally!)
